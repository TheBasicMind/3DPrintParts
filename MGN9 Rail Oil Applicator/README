README MGN19 Rail Oil Applicator

Print out. Semi flex material like NGEN Flex is best though PETG will probably also work. Put on rail in front of carriage (or rather snap it on if printed 
in PETG). Add a few drops of oil in the applicator on both sides of the rail. Make sure it is the right way round (the tabs are smaller in one side so the
oil will be dispensed on to the rail groove. Ensure that side is fscing the carriage). Push the carriage along the rail with the applicator in front of it and oil
will be applied to the rail groove and directly enter the carriage, lubing the ballbearings.
