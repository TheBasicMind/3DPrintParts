SK-Go Enclosure

The enclosure step files have been sized specifically to match the dimensions of my SK-Go as built. There are some places
where the dimensions of the SK-Go build can vary according to the builders preference.

1. The height of the lower horizontal extrusions. On my SK-Go the horizontal extrusions are 20mm above Z=0 (the table the
printer is on) if the plastic pads/feet are included. 16mm to the bottom of the vertically oriented extrusions if the 
pads/feet are not fitted. The design should support some small variation (approx +/- 2mm) to this height.

2. The z motor location is not completely fixed. It will be easiest to measure exactly where your z motor is located on 
the x and y plane and move the hole in the step file accomodating the bracket and the motor to match. Otherwise you may
have to move the motor on the cross bar extrusion (not too bad, but best avoided if you have everything working well already.
Or worse, if you didn't follow the precise y positioning for the crossbar, move the cross bar extrusion itself (big job!)

Note if the rails are fixed in stopper position A there will be room for a filament spool placed at the rear of the print
bed within the printer enclosure. Nice!

Enjoy!
