Hemera Volcano Nozzle Change Tool


Fed up with breaking your heat break when changing your nozzle on the Hemera? Then this tool is for you. 

It also requires three lengths of 6mm steel square section rod cut to size (6mm door handle spindle will do just fine and is available for very low cost). A hacksaw should do it. It also requires a long 7mm steel hex wrench socket.
