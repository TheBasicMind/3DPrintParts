Hemera Mount for SK-Go

The step files are sized for perfect fit (e.g. the sheet material is 3mm and the pockets sizes are 3mm). In setting
up the CAM toolpaths for the CNC work I set stock to leave as 0.0. In effect this means approimately an additional 0.1mm  
will be removed from the part. This resulted in a tight press fit, where clamps were required to assemble the part. 

Pockets with square corners

The pocket corners have not been rounded because the mill bit size is not pressuposed. The part can be machined using
1/4 inch and 1/8th inch mill bits or smaller metric equivalents. Use 1/8th inch where required for the smaller pockets.
Pocket corners have been left square so inside corner radii can conveniently match the selected tool size.

Once the press fitting is made, it will be difficult if not impossible to dissassemble without damaging the parts. 
Therefore double check all parts are correctly oriented before proceeding. In particular pay attendion to the L 
shaped cooling fan bracket leg and the additional cutout on the top part which needs to be oriented the right way to allow space for the Hemera
filament loading level to be operated.
