SK-Go Printer Bed Brace for 9 Point Levelling Print Plate

These printer bed braces are inspired by the bed braces produced by Benoît Barbé for the original Aluminium print bed frame but remodelled for the newer steel 9 point bed.

Note: these braces have asymmetrical spacing to maximise the addressable bed size when using my aluminium Hemera mount.  

 
Enjoy!
