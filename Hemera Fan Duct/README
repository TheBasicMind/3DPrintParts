Fan Duct for SK-Go Hemera Mount

Note: Due to me making an error when assembling my Hemera Mount, the fan duct bracket in this set, is designed to fit over the aluminium legs in the orientation they have been fitted on my SK-Go.

THESE FILES NEED TO BE MODIFIED TO FIT THE INTENDED HEMERA MOUNT THAT IS PUBLISHED IN THIS REPOSITORY.

In other words it is unlikely you can just print out these files and use them without modification. For this reason I have not supplied the .stl

If you wish to modify the files to use this with the Hemera Mount published here, then check the orientation of the aluminium "legs" and push and pull the relevant parts of this bracket to take account of the 3mm aluminium sheet thickness.

Enjoy
